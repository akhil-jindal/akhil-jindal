Hi.  I'm Akhil.  I research computational, mathematical and physical approaches for predicting protein-protein interactions
to improve rationale drug design with [Applied BioComputation Group]('https://abcgroup.cluspro.org/).

Currently, I am working on a mechanistic computer-aided drug discovery approach for [COVID-19])('https://laufer-covid.org/).

Prior to returning to school, I worked at [IBM]('https://www.ibm.com/us-en/') and the [CDC]('https://www.cdc.gov/),
managing many intellectual property (IP) activities, from preparation and prosecution of patents to creating 
new internal IP policies and guidelines.
